# Simple Keylogger

This is a basic keylogger program written in Python. It captures keystrokes and logs them to a file for educational and testing purposes. **Use this tool responsibly and only with explicit consent**.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes to a file (`keylog.txt`).
- Detects and logs both alphanumeric and special keys (e.g., `Enter`, `Backspace`).
- Stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- `pynput` library

Install `pynput` using:
```bash
pip install pynput
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diablo-101/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
   cd simple-keylogger
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

3. All keystrokes will be logged to `keylog.txt` in the same directory.

4. Press the `Esc` key to stop logging.
